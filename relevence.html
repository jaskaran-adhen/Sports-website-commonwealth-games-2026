                <p>Sport underpins the unique connections and friendships which bring together a third of the world’s
                    population as citizens of the nations and territories of the Commonwealth. For more than eight
                    decades the Commonwealth Games Federation has taken a global leadership role in uniting the
                    Commonwealth’s athletes, citizens and communities through the transformative and connecting power of
                    sport.<br></br>

                    We're inspired by the diversity and dynamism of the Commonwealth itself - a voluntary association of
                    72 nations and territories - and its enduring commitment to human rights, democracy and the rule of
                    law. Among our membership are some of the world’s largest and smallest countries, from India, with
                    over 1.2 billion people to Niue with a population of 1,600. More than 60% of the Commonwealth
                    citizens are under 30. <br></br>

                    Today, the Commonwealth Games Federation is far more than the curator of a great Games. As a
                    cornerstone of the Commonwealth itself, our dynamic sporting movement – driven by its values of
                    Humanity, Equality and Destiny – has a key role to play in an energised, engaged and active
                    Commonwealth of Nations and Territories. And with new members joining, a hugely successful Gold
                    Coast 2018 , preparations for Birmingham 2022 well underway, the Commonwealth is entering an era of
                    renewed relevance.<br></br>

                    Every organisation and individual that works with us and supports us in our mission is part of the
                    Commonwealth Sports Movement.<br></p>
