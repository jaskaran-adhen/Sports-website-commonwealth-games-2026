				<h1>2026 Commonwealth Games</h1>
				<p>The 2026 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XXIII Commonwealth Games and commonly known as
					Victoria 2026, is a multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth scheduled to take place across
					four regional sites in the Australian state of Victoria: Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat and Gippsland.
					The opening ceremonies will be held in the state capital Melbourne at the Melbourne Cricket Ground
					and the closing ceremonies will be held at the Kardinia Park in Geelong. In a departure from
					previous Commonwealth Games, the event will not be held in one major city but will be hosted by the
					state and held across a number of regional cities outside the capital. The Games will take place
					over twelve days between 17 and 29 March 2026.<br>

					The 2026 Commonwealth Games will be the first to be held since the death of Queen Elizabeth II and
					the accession of King Charles III as Head of the Commonwealth and reigning monarch of the
					Commonwealth Realms on 8 September 2022.<br>

					The host city was initially intended to be selected at the 2019 Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF)
					General Assembly in Kigali, Rwanda. On 16 June 2019, the CGF confirmed that it would decide the
					host city in 2020, but the lack of interest from cities and the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the
					announcement. In December 2021, the CGF reported that it would announce a host some time in March
					2022; however, Victoria was announced as the host on 12 April 2022, after two months of an
					exclusive dialogue process with the CGF.<br></p>
